A new take on banded. Done better, and stronger and smarter. 



Just adding some text to test dev deployment. 


working with this locally??


You'll need a few things. 

Firstly, I used a postgres DB.  According to the fine producers of the Djaango project, it provides great features that the other db's just don't. 
P.S. I like having JSON on my objects...just saying. 

To get this working on a mac locally you need a DB driver

$ brew install postgresql

of course, you'll need the an actual DB behind the resources.  I have environment vars.  What do you have?

Then, install the requirements. 

$ pip install -r requiremenst.txt
